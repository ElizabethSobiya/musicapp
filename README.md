#Music App
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This is a MusicApp, where top 10 artists and top 10 songs were added.

The user can give ratings to the songs and they can add songs and there artists.

#API
I created Api using GRAPHQL and used that API for rendering data in the songs and artists column.

As I don't have any prior knowledge or experience in the backend, I got to know about GraphQL from my brother. And I learned GRAPHQL for creating Query and Mutation. But I faced lots of issues in mutation.
